This curriculum has been designed for my personal objectives. Feel free to use it as a template for your own personal curriculum.

The course has been divided into 3 years. To be honest, I don't have the patience to hold on to this for 3 years so I'll try to complete the course in a shorter time frame without compromising with knowledge gained.

<b> Guiding Principles</b>
1. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MTRxRO5SRA'>Sal Khan's mastery principle</a> - 'To not move to the next level until a mastery has been achieved over the current level.'
2. <a href ='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2011/09/01/learn-faster/'>Feynman's technique given by Scott Young</a> - 'The best way to learn something is to pretend that you're teaching it to someone else.'

<b>Objectives</b>
1. To master basic mathematics (calculus, linear algebra, etc)
2. Further use this knowledge in the fields of artificial intelligence and data science.
3. Better understand the concepts of computer science, physics, chemcial engineering etc.
