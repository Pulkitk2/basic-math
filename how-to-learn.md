My ultimate aim is to learn mathematics at the undergraduate level at an increased pace. Since I am planning to learn this in a shorter duration of time, I have to try a different approach which makes my learning more effective and productive.

My strategy will roughly be based upon these guiding principles:
1. <a href = 'https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2011/09/01/learn-faster/'>Feynman technique</a>
2. Online lectures
3. Practice problems
4. Reading books
5. Practical problem-solving
6. Blogging daily about whatever I learn/do on the day
7. <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MTRxRO5SRA'>Mastery</a>
